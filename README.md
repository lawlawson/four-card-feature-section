## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a HTML & CSS project with a particular focusing on responsiveness. I decided to use CSS Grid to implement the layout of the boxes, particularly the change between tablet and larger screen sizes. The change in layout between the larger sizes was the most challenging aspect and required some research to implement a working solution as from the designs.
